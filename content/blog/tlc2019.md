I started writing this post in the Berlin Tegel airport.
Totally exhausted but with a lot of thought in mind.
The lightning conference was a success.
It was my first Bitcoin only conference and I feel like Alice waking up
after her rabbit hole dream.

# Day 0 - The Meetup dev

Location: [AHOY](https://www.ahoyberlin.com/)

My plan landed the morning, at 9:00, and I went directly to the meetup.

As described in the invitation email, it was an open meetup without
any prior agenda, focused on technical questions around the
Lightning Network. We had tables to sit down and work on,
as well as a small area for impromptu talks, announcements or demos.
It was completely self-organized.

I attended the rust-lightning workshop organised by ariard.
The exercise consisted to clone a bootstrapping
[repository](https://github.com/ariard/hacking-rust-lightning)
become familiar with the library interfaces and write a minimal
implementation of a lightning client.
The lack of space in the main room droved us to work in front of
the bar. It was difficult to discuss in this area because of the
noise of the crowd, but it was very instructive.

My check-in to the hotel was at 6:00pm. I left the space, took the
subway and get out to the nearest station. I could take the bus then, but I
wanted to look at the street of Berlin. Walking along a wall, thinking
of the Lightning, the exciting future to come, I noticed after several
hundred meters how long this wall was and the size of its paintings.

On a little sign, near the ground, was written: **Berliner Mauer**. \\
One month before its 30th anniversary, this wall did not catch my eyes. \\
The contemporary concrete and its cold appearance feels actual. \\
A rigid line separating families and friends feels actual. \\
The cold war against individual liberties feels actual.

The rain did not spoil the after-party, which was organised in
a nice pub [Hirsch & Hase](https://hirschundhase.de/), near the station
Voltastraße. Free Beer and free food ! But after hanging out with the
French people group, we decided to try the famous Room77 pub.

# Room 77 and the 600,000th block

Location: [Room77](http://www.room77.de/) - Graefestraße 77, Berlin

```
 ──▄▄█▀▀▀▀▀█▄▄─  Room77 is one of the first place in the world wich
▄█▀──▄─▄────▀█▄  accepted cryptocurrency payments.
█───▀█▀▀▀▀▄───█
█────█▄▄▄▄▀───█  A big Bitcoin sign in neon welcome you as you enter in
█────█────█───█  a warm room with a cypherpunk ambiance. Price is good
▀█▄─▀▀█▀█▀──▄█▀  and service is impeccable.
──▀▀█▄▄▄▄▄█▀▀──
```

We had a lot of fun in this pub, which is quite cosy and pleasant. It
was certainly the first and the last time we enjoyed it not overcrowded
by the thirsty lightning community. Paying with lightning was really
easy, a small machine displaying the qr-code was passing by the staff
who was totally used to handle this kind of transaction.

Coincidence or not it was the same night that the peer-to-peer
distributed timestamp server of the Bitcoin protocole would generate its
600 000th block, generating a computational proof of a chronological
order of transaction for thousand of peers of its network and anchoring
in time the issuance of 12.5 bitcoins inside the existing 18 millions.
We waited for it, drinking beers and discussing about mostly informatics
and community, refreshing some time a bright web page on our phone in
the subdued light of the pub.

We spent all our time in the bar until the 600 000th block happened,
local time was around 2am. We celebrated it with a round of applause and
a last drink, but tired by this long day I was happy to go to bed.

[c-base](https://c-base.org) is the oldest crashed space station on earth.


I have unstacked a lot of sats playing with the funny
hardware of the second floor, buying stickers, hot chocolate, coffee and
beer. The speed of transaction was very fast and with very few fee,
Although my Eclair Wallet has only two channels.
